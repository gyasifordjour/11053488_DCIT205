# What I've Learned
Throughout the development of this project, I've gained valuable experience and skills, including:

Web Development: Understanding the intricacies of building a responsive and interactive website using modern web technologies.

User Experience Design: Enhancing the user experience through intuitive navigation, responsive design, and engaging content presentation.

Version Control: I have had more insight in the use of Git and Github. That is how to fork a repository, make commit and how to make a pull request. Futher more some mistakes led me to do futher researches, like how to undo commit, revert and reset a commited and also how to delete a repository.
